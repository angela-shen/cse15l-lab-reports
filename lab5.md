## Part 1 - Ed Discussion

## Part 2 - Reflection 
I really liked learning more about vim commands. I have been using vim for the past year, 
and I've probably used it more than VSCode, but I never really learned much beyond exiting, 
saving, switching between visual/insert modes, and deleting a whole line. Learning about 
searching, typing in a number to jump a certain number of lines forward/backwards, and 
using commands to delete individual words or letters was very helpful and improved my efficiency.
